	\section{Detector qualification and commissioning \textcolor{blue}{ 19 pages}}
		\subsection{Module assembly \textcolor{red}{ 3 pages}}
		Test with different glues, solidity and current, show the effect of dry air on the glue, show the chip getting unglued etc. 
		\subsection{Characterization set-up \textcolor{red}{ 3 pages}}
		Show the two set-ups with the cooling plates, APP, LB power supplies and oscilloscope
		\subsection{Front-End working points \textcolor{red}{ 2 pages}}
		Explain how two working point are needed for the different planes and how the different working points were defined, explain that all of the test had to be done for these two working points
		\subsection{Threshold and Noise scans \textcolor{red}{ 4 pages}}
		Plot of the distribution of the threshold value for all the ASIC, also show at the threshold what is the amount of problematic pixels
		Understand what to say about these value 
		ON the noise scan, see if there is a correlation with the position within the ASIC, SC, SP etc
